## How does Docsify Structure Data?
Docsify does not generate static html files. Basically that means that it doesn't change your markdown into html, but it loads, parses, and displays the markdown as is. The build routine process takes the files, but does not compile them into just HTML/CSS. Because of this you don't have to worry about any sort of translation mistakes. Here are all of the files I have in order to make this whole site run.

To create a page all docsify requires in a new markdown file. You can then link to it with thte simple sidebar function. Using _sidebar.md creates a menu in order to display all the data. All you have to do is input a list of all the pages you want and link them to the markdown file. In these 8 simple lines of code I can create an easily accessible site.

<!-- How this system structures data. Explain how it manages a hierarchy of content, screenshots and examples of the relation between the website and file system are required. This is the key section for convincing the team this is secure and leverages their existing skill sets (HTML / CSS) -->
