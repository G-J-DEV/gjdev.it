# Pro vs. Con
Overall I would recommend docsify, but there are some things to keep in mind before you jump right in.

## Pro
 - Easy setup
 - Mostly beginner friedly
 - Lots of useful online information
 - Also lots of plugins on open source
 - Easy to update

## Con 
 - HTML/Markdown knowledge helpful
 - Also requires command line knowledge
 - Requires outside hosting
 - Doesn't allow for a login
 - Bad at dynamic data

The cons were so hard to come up with.
