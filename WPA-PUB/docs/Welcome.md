# Introduction
## What is it?
To begin [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) is a static site generator to make building a website easier. This means that it loads your markdown files and displays them on a site. It doesnt include the front-end library of posting. Instead a user has to utilize a markdown and HTML, which it will then display. Docsify is very simple and beginner friendly, with almost no background knowlwedge needed. It claims to be magical and honestly, I believe them.

## Getting stated in Docsify
To get started, there are a lot of very helpful articles and how to videos to create a site with docsify, but the first place to look is with docsify themselves. They have created their own [site](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) actually using docsify, which definetly makes me feel good. Any company that actively uses their own product definetly believes in it. The steps are very easy and link to more in-depth help for true beginners that may require a little more background. 

## Hosting a site
Because docsify doesn't host, you need to utilize another source like reclaim hosting, github pages, or netlify. I personally chose Github pages, but they are all great options. Docsify offers [directions](https://docsify.js.org/#/deploy) on deploying to a large variety of hosts. Again, its very straight forward and helpful.
